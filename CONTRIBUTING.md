- 💡 **Feature suggestions** - Propose new capabilities

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (see [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/fabric-cicd/#installation) for version requirements)
- [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows) or [Az.Accounts PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Accounts/2.2.3)
- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Initial Configuration

1. **Fork the Repository on GitHub**:
    - Go to the repository [fabric-cicd](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-cicd) on GitHub
    - In the top right corner, click on the **Fork** button
    - This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account

1. **Clone Your Forked Repository**:
    - Once the fork is complete, go to your GitHub account and open the forked repository
    - Click on the **Code** button, and clone to VS Code

1. **Run activate.ps1**:
    - Open the Project in VS Code
    - Open PowerShell terminal
    - Run `activate.ps1` which will install `uv`, and `ruff` if not already found. And set up the default environment leveraging `uv sync`
        ```powershell
        .\activate.ps1
        ```
        _Note that this is technically optional and is designed to work with PowerShell. You can execute these steps manually as well, this is merely a helper_
        _For Linux, run `activate.sh` instead_

1. **Select Python Interpreter**:
    - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select `Python: Select Interpreter`
    - Choose the interpreter from the `.venv` directory

1. **Ensure All VS Code Extensions Are Installed**:
    - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select `Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions`
    - Install all extensions recommended for the workspace

## Development

### Managing Dependencies

- All dependencies in this project are managed by `uv` which will resolve all dependencies and lock the versions to speed up virtual environment creation
- For additions, run:
    ```sh
    uv add <package-name>
    ```
- For removals, run:
    ```sh
    uv remove <package-name>
    ```

### Code Formatting & Linting

- The python code within this project is maintained by `ruff`
- If you install the recommended extensions, `ruff` will auto format on save of any file
- Before being able to merge a PR, `ruff` is ran in a GitHub Action to ensure the files are properly formatted and maintained
- To force linting, run the following
    ```sh
    uv run ruff format
    uv run ruff check
    ```

## Contribution process

To avoid cases where submitted PRs are rejected, please follow the following steps:

- To report a new issue, follow [Create an issue](#creating-an-issue)
- To work on existing issue, follow [Find an issue to work on](#finding-an-issue-to-work-on)
- To contribute code, follow [Pull request process](#pull-request-process)

### Creating an issue

Before reporting a new bug or suggesting a feature, please search the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-cicd/issues) to check if one already exists.

All reported bugs or feature suggestions must start with creating an issue in the GitHub Issues pane. Please add as much information as possible to help us with triage and understanding. Once the issue is triaged, labels will be added to indicate its status (e.g., "need more info", "help wanted").

When creating an issue please select the relevant template, e.g., bug, new feature, general question, etc. and provide all required input:

- [Bug Report](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-cicd/issues/new?template=1-bug.yml)
- [Feature Request](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-cicd/issues/new?template=2-feature.yml)
- [Documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-cicd/issues/new?template=3-documentation.yml)
- [Question](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-cicd/issues/new?template=4-question.yml)

We aim to respond to new issues promptly, but response times may vary depending on workload and priority.

### Finding an issue to work on

#### For Beginners

If you're new to contributing, look for issues with these labels:

- **`good-first-issue`** - Beginner-friendly tasks that are well-scoped and documented
- **`help wanted`** - Issues where community contributions are especially welcome
- **`documentation`** - Improve docs, examples, or help text (great for first contributions)

#### Getting Started Tips

1. **Start small** - Look for typo fixes, documentation improvements, or simple bug fixes
2. **Read existing code** - Familiarize yourself with the codebase by exploring similar commands
3. **Ask questions** - Comment on issues to clarify requirements or get guidance
4. **Test locally** - Always test your changes thoroughly before submitting

#### Before You Code

All PRs must be linked with a "help wanted" issue. To avoid rework after investing effort:

1. **Comment on the issue** - Express interest and describe your planned approach
2. **Wait for acknowledgment** - Get team confirmation before starting significant work
3. **Ask for clarification** - Don't hesitate to ask questions about requirements

Please review [engineering guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-cicd/wiki) for coding guidelines and common flows to help you with your task.

### Pull request process

**All pull requests must be linked to an approved issue,** see [PR Title Format](#pr-title-format). This ensures proper tracking and context for changes. Before creating a pull request:

1. **Create or identify an existing issue** that describes the problem, feature request, or change you're addressing
2. **Comment on the issue** to express interest and get team acknowledgment before starting work

#### PR Title Format

Your PR title MUST follow this exact format: `"Fixes #123 - Short Description"` where #123 is the issue number.

- Use "Fixes" for bug fixes, "Closes" for features, "Resolves" for other changes
- Example: "Fixes #520 - Add Python version requirements to documentation"
- Version bump PRs are an exception: title must be "vX.X.X" format only
- GitHub Actions will automatically check that your PR is linked to a valid issue and will fail if no valid reference is found

#### Before Submitting PR

Verify that:

- The PR is focused on the related task
- Tests coverage is kept and all tests pass
- Your code is aligned with the code conventions of this project

#### Review Process

- Use a descriptive title and provide a clear summary of your changes
- Address and resolve all review comments before merge
- PRs will be labeled as "need author feedback" when there are comments to resolve
- Approved PRs will be merged by the fabric-cicd team
