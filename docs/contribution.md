## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.10 or higher)
-   [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)
-   [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows) or [Az.Accounts PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Accounts/2.2.3)
-   [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Initial Configuration

1. **Fork the Repository on GitHub**:

    - Go to the repository [fabric-cicd](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-cicd) on GitHub.
    - In the top right corner, click on the **Fork** button.
    - This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

1. **Clone Your Forked Repository**:

    - Once the fork is complete, go to your GitHub account and open the forked repository.
    - Click on the **Code** button, and clone to VS Code.

1. **Run activate.ps1**:

    - Open the Project in VS Code
    - Open PowerShell terminal
    - Run activate.ps1 which will install uv, and ruff if not already found. And set up the default environment leveraging uv sync.
        ```powershell
        .\activate.ps1
        ```
        _Note that this is technically optional and is designed to work with PowerShell. You can execute these steps manually as well, this is merely a helper_

1. **Select Python Interpreter**:

    - Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select `Python: Select Interpreter`.
    - Choose the interpreter from the `venv` directory.

1. **Ensure All VS Code Extensions Are Installed**:

    - Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select `Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions`.
    - Install all extensions recommended for the workspace.

## Development

### Managing Dependencies

-   All dependencies in this project are managed by uv which will resolve all dependencies and lock the versions to speed up virtual environment creation.
-   For additions, run:
    ```sh
    uv add <package-name>
    ```
-   For removals, run:
    ```sh
    uv remove <package-name>
    ```

### Code Formatting & Linting

-   The python code within this project is maintained by ruff.
-   If you install the recommended extensions, ruff will auto format on save of any file.
-   Before being able to merge a PR, ruff is ran in a Github Action to ensure the files are properly formatted and maintained.
-   To force linting, run the following.
    ```sh
    ruff format
    ruff check
    ```
